    "In this repo I want to try and create a relational map of a movie database based on the information parsed from the database. First dataset we will use is a more limited set. However, later we will go through a Netflix dataset that we have generated. The end goal should be two fully fleshed out dendrograms. This will largely be demonstrating the python data analysis, statistics, and machine learning tools and technology I have been self learning.\n",
